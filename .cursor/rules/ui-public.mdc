description: Preserve existing visual design for public trip pages
globs:

- Do not introduce Tailwind or shadcn/ui into public routes.
- Use the existing global CSS and class names from the legacy site; aim for pixel parity.
- Do not rename classes or change typography/spacing/color tokens without explicit approval.
- Avoid global resets or overrides (e.g., Tailwind preflight) that affect public pages.
- CSS Modules are allowed for new isolated pieces, but must not alter global look.

- **Responsiveness**: Maintain mobile‑first behavior.
  - Trip nav must wrap or horizontally scroll on small screens; tap targets ≥ 44px.
  - Grids collapse to single column under 768px.
  - Images/maps are fluid width; maps ~300px (mobile) / 480px (desktop) height.
- **Style guardrails**: Do not modify `app/(public)/styles/public.css` tokens or class names without updating `docs/STYLE_GUIDE_PUBLIC_UI.md` and getting approval.
