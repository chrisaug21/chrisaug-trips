- The app is mobile‑first. Breakpoints: 480px, 768px, 1024px.
- Public routes must preserve legacy look on mobile & desktop with pixel parity.
- Admin routes must be fully usable on small screens; no horizontal scrolling. Labels above fields; buttons ≥ 44px height.
- Use `clamp()` for heading sizes where appropriate to maintain proportions.
