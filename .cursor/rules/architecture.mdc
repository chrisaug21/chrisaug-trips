description: Architecture & framework decisions for Trip Planner MVP (Netlify + Next.js + Supabase)
alwaysApply: true
---
- Use Next.js App Router deployed on Netlifyâ€™s Next runtime.
- Database is Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage). Do not introduce other DBs without approval.
- TypeScript everywhere. Keep server code in route handlers/server actions.
- Validation with Zod at all boundaries (forms, API, AI output).
- Leaflet + OSM for maps. Do not add heavy mapping libs.
- Keep dependencies light. Ask before adding large libs.
