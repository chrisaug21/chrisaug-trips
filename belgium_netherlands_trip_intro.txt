üó∫ Trip Overview
Welcome to your unforgettable journey through Belgium and the Netherlands, where centuries of history, art, and culture meet picturesque canals, medieval architecture, and culinary delights.
Your adventure begins in the medieval beauty of Ghent, Belgium, with its stunning castle, winding canals, and vibrant local scene away from the tourist crowds.
From Ghent, you'll venture to the fairytale-like charm of Bruges for a day trip, where chocolate shops, breweries, and cobblestone streets create a truly magical atmosphere. Before heading to the Netherlands, you'll enjoy a brief exploration of Antwerp, known for its impressive architecture and fashion scene.
In the Netherlands, Utrecht will serve as your home base - a delightful university city with canals and a historic center without Amsterdam's tourist crowds. From here, you'll take day trips to charming Delft with its famous blue pottery and iconic Amsterdam with its distinctive canal rings and lively atmosphere. And as a special bonus, you'll be in the Netherlands during tulip season and for King's Day (April 30), one of the country's biggest celebrations!
Throughout your journey, you'll discover local caf√©s and brown bars, sample distinctive regional specialties from Belgian chocolate and beer to Dutch stroopwafels and jenever, and immerse yourselves in the laid-back yet vibrant culture of these two fascinating countries.
